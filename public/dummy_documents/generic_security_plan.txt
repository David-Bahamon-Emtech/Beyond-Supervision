SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
1.1 Purpose: This Incident Response Plan (IRP) provides a framework for [Applicant Company Name] to respond to and manage information security incidents effectively, minimizing impact, and restoring services promptly.
1.2 Objectives:
    - To define what constitutes an information security incident.
    - To establish clear roles, responsibilities, and communication channels for incident response.
    - To outline procedures for incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review.
    - To ensure timely and appropriate communication with internal stakeholders, customers, and regulatory bodies as required.
    - To facilitate continuous improvement of incident response capabilities.

SECTION 2: SCOPE
This plan applies to all information systems, data, and networks owned, managed, or utilized by [Applicant Company Name], and to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors with access to these resources.

SECTION 3: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
3.1 Incident Response Team (IRT): A dedicated IRT is established, comprising representatives from:
    - IT/Security (Lead) - [Dummy IRT Lead Name, e.g., Mr. Alex Secure]
    - Management - [Dummy Management Rep Name]
    - Legal/Compliance - [Dummy Legal Rep Name]
    - Public Relations/Communications (as needed) - [Dummy PR Rep Name]
    - Relevant Business Units (as needed)
3.2 Responsibilities of IRT Lead: Overall coordination of incident response activities, decision-making during an incident, and reporting to senior management.
3.3 Responsibilities of IRT Members: Executing tasks as defined in this plan, providing expertise, and supporting containment and recovery efforts.
3.4 All Employees: Responsible for identifying and reporting potential security incidents immediately to their manager or the IT/Security department.

SECTION 4: INCIDENT RESPONSE PHASES
The incident response process follows these key phases:

4.1 Preparation:
    - Maintaining and updating this IRP.
    - Regular training and awareness programs for employees and IRT members.
    - Maintaining necessary tools and resources (e.g., forensic software, communication channels, access to logs).
    - Conducting drills and simulations.

4.2 Identification:
    - Detecting and reporting security events through various means (e.g., IDS/IPS alerts, user reports, log analysis, antivirus alerts, third-party notifications).
    - Initial assessment to determine if an event constitutes an incident.
    - Documenting initial findings: date/time, source of alert, description of event, affected systems/data.

4.3 Containment:
    - Taking immediate steps to limit the scope and impact of the incident.
    - Strategies may include isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IP addresses, disabling compromised accounts, or disconnecting from the network.
    - Differentiating between short-term and long-term containment.
    - Preserving evidence for forensic analysis.

4.4 Eradication:
    - Identifying and eliminating the root cause of the incident.
    - Removing malware, closing vulnerabilities, and ensuring affected systems are clean.
    - Validating that the threat has been fully removed.

4.5 Recovery:
    - Restoring affected systems and services to normal operation in a secure manner.
    - Restoring data from backups if necessary.
    - Verifying system functionality and security.
    - Monitoring systems closely post-recovery for any signs of recurrence.

4.6 Post-Incident Activities (Lessons Learned):
    - Conducting a post-incident review meeting within [e.g., two weeks] of incident closure.
    - Analyzing the incident and the response: what happened, what worked well, what could be improved, and the actual impact.
    - Updating the IRP, security policies, and controls based on lessons learned.
    - Documenting the incident and response for audit and compliance purposes.

SECTION 5: INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION AND PRIORITIZATION
(Example Severity Levels - a real plan would have detailed criteria)
    - Critical (High Impact): Significant data breach, prolonged service outage affecting many users, major financial loss, regulatory breach. Requires immediate IRT activation.
    - Major (Medium Impact): Localized service disruption, minor data exposure, limited financial impact. Requires IRT assessment.
    - Minor (Low Impact): Isolated malware infection, unsuccessful intrusion attempt, policy violation with no data loss. Handled by IT/Security with IRT awareness.

SECTION 6: COMMUNICATION PLAN
6.1 Internal Communication: Procedures for alerting IRT members, IT staff, and relevant management.
6.2 External Communication:
    - Regulatory Bodies: Reporting incidents as required by applicable laws and regulations (e.g., data breaches to Data Protection Authorities).
    - Customers/Users: Communicating service disruptions or data breaches to affected parties in a timely and transparent manner, as advised by Legal and PR.
    - Law Enforcement: Engaging law enforcement agencies if criminal activity is suspected.
    - Third Parties: Notifying affected vendors or partners.

SECTION 7: PLAN TESTING AND MAINTENANCE
This IRP will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or as significant changes occur in the IT environment or threat landscape. Tabletop exercises and/or simulations will be conducted [e.g., semi-annually] to test the plan's effectiveness.
