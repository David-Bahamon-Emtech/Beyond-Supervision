--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for [Product/Service Name]. It outlines the key components, their interactions, data flows, and the technologies employed. The architecture is designed for scalability, security, and resilience, in compliance with regulatory expectations for financial services.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. ARCHITECTURE GOALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Security: Implementation of industry best practices for data protection, access control, and threat mitigation.
    - Scalability: Ability to handle increasing transaction volumes and user load.
    - Reliability: Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
    - Maintainability: Modular design for ease of updates and maintenance.
    - Compliance: Adherence to relevant regulatory and data governance standards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. KEY COMPONENTS (Logical Diagram Placeholder)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [ USER INTERFACE LAYER ]
        |   - Web Application (React/Angular/Vue)
        |   - Mobile Applications (iOS - Swift/Objective-C, Android - Kotlin/Java)
        V
    [ API GATEWAY / LOAD BALANCER ] (e.g., Nginx, AWS API Gateway)
        |   - Authentication & Authorization Services (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT)
        |   - Rate Limiting & Throttling
        V
    [ APPLICATION LAYER / MICROSERVICES ]
        |   - User Service (Manages user profiles, authentication)
        |   - Account Service (Manages customer accounts, balances)
        |   - Transaction Service (Processes payments, transfers, trades)
        |   - KYC/AML Service (Integrates with due diligence tools)
        |   - Reporting Service (Generates regulatory and business reports)
        |   - Notification Service (Email, SMS, Push Notifications)
        V
    [ DATA STORAGE LAYER ]
        |   - Primary Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle - for transactional data, user profiles, account info)
        |       - Replication: Primary/Standby for HA
        |       - Encryption: Data at Rest & Data in Transit
        |   - Data Warehouse / Analytics DB (e.g., Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake - for reporting, analytics)
        |   - Cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached - for frequently accessed data)
        |   - Document Store (e.g., MongoDB, S3 - for KYC documents, logs)
        V
    [ INTEGRATION LAYER / EXTERNAL SERVICES ]
        |   - Banking Partners / Payment Networks (e.g., SWIFT, ACH, Card Networks via APIs)
        |   - Sanction List Providers (e.g., OFAC, UN, EU via APIs)
        |   - Identity Verification Services (KYC provider APIs)
        |   - Regulatory Reporting Systems (FIU Gateway APIs)
        |   - Monitoring & Logging Systems (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. DATA FLOW (Simplified Example for a Payment Transaction)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. User initiates payment via Web/Mobile App.
    2. Request hits API Gateway, authenticated.
    3. Transaction Service receives request.
    4. Account Service verifies funds/limits.
    5. AML Service checks transaction against rules.
    6. Transaction Service processes payment (interacts with Banking Partner API if external).
    7. Primary Database records transaction details.
    8. Notification Service informs user of transaction status.
    9. Data replicated to Data Warehouse for analytics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Network Security: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), DDoS Mitigation.
    - Application Security: Secure coding practices (OWASP Top 10), regular penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.
    - Data Security: Encryption at rest (e.g., AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+). Segregation of data. Access controls based on principle of least privilege.
    - Access Control: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for users and administrators. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    - Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive audit trails for all system activities and transactions. Real-time security event monitoring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT (Example)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Cloud Provider: [e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP]
    - Containerization: [e.g., Docker, Kubernetes for microservices deployment]
    - CI/CD Pipeline: [e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a placeholder document for demonstration purposes. A real system architecture diagram would typically include detailed visual diagrams (e.g., using UML, C4 model, or other standard diagramming tools) rather than purely textual descriptions.
