# Beyond Supervision Demo Platform - V0.1

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2025-06-18

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the initial plan and structure for the **Beyond Supervision** Demo Platform. The goal is to create a functional React-based demonstration showcasing modern SupTech (Supervisory Technology) capabilities for financial regulators, drawing inspiration from real-world requirements and advanced concepts like embedded supervision.

## 2. Core Objectives

The platform aims to demonstrate support for the following core supervisory functions:

* Licensing & Registration
* Reporting (Financial, Statistical, Prudential, AML, Ad-hoc)
* Supervision (Macro/Micro, Offsite/Onsite)
* Risk Assessment & Monitoring
* Workflow Management
* Communication & Correspondence
* Dashboards & Analytics
* Audit/Examination Management
* Market Conduct Oversight
* Enforcement Actions

## 3. Technical Stack & Structure

* **Frontend Framework:** React
* **Build Tool / Dev Environment:** Vite (with SWC)
* **Layout:** Based on the provided `Layout.js` and `Sidebar.js` components, featuring a fixed left-hand sidebar for navigation (reflecting the new structure) and a main content area.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with custom theme extensions for UI consistency).
* **State Management:** Primarily uses React Context (e.g., `WorkflowContext` for global workflow states) and local component state. Feature-specific data and API interactions are handled within co-located service files (e.g., `licensingService.js`).
* **Navigation**: Custom state-driven navigation managed in `App.jsx` to switch between main modules/views.
* **API Integration**: The React frontend communicates with the Express.js backend via RESTful APIs. These API calls are typically encapsulated within JavaScript service files co-located with feature components (e.g., `licensingService.js`, `reportingService.js`).
*   **Backend Stack:**
    *   **Framework:** Express.js (Node.js)
    *   **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js)
    *   **Core AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (currently using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for template generation and `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` for analytics).
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Real-time AI template generation with Server-Sent Events (SSE).
        *   AI-powered analytics over structured CSV data, returning JSON (for scalars, tables, and chart configurations).
        *   On-the-fly PDF and DOCX generation from template content (`pdfkit`, `docx`).
        *   In-memory data caching for analytics (data loaded from CSV files in `ai-template-backend/scripts/`).
        *   In-memory storage for AI-generated templates.

## 4. Key Design Considerations

* **Responsive UI:** Optimized for tablet and laptop displays.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different views/permissions based on user roles.
* **Audit Trail:** Log all significant actions.
* **Localization:** Support for different languages and currencies (placeholders).
* **Secure Communication:** Secure messaging and file exchange.
* **Upload Validation:** Implement validation rules/templates for reporting.
* **Modern UX:** Intuitive navigation (including potential sub-menus), clean layouts, clear workflows.
* **Build Process:** Leverage Vite's optimized build process.
* **High Availability & DR:** Conceptual consideration for resilience.
* **Integration Hooks:** Design with potential integration points.

## 6. Advanced Capabilities

* **AI-Powered Template Generation:** The system can generate various types of regulatory templates (e.g., checklists, policy documents, communication drafts) using prompts to the Gemini API. Responses are streamed in real-time. Generated templates can be downloaded as PDF or DOCX.
* **AI-Powered Data Analytics:** Users can ask natural language questions about platform data (currently from CSV sources like licenses, applications, entities). The backend uses the Gemini API to process these queries and return structured JSON responses, suitable for displaying as text, tables, or charts (using Chart.js on the frontend).

* **Automated Compliance Checks (Conceptual):** System cross-validates submitted data/documents against configured rules/guidelines.
* **Custom Forms/Surveys:** Initial steps towards this are implemented with `ApplicationFormManagement` and `ApplicationFormDesignerModal` within the Management & Configuration module, allowing for the design of dynamic forms.
* **DeFi Embedded Supervision (Conceptual):** Conceptual dashboard elements showing real-time data/compliance from integrated protocols.

## 7. Future Considerations / V0.1 Goals

* Develop interactive React components reflecting the **new sidebar hierarchy**.
* Implement routing to handle navigation between these sections/subsections. (Currently uses state-based navigation; `react-router-dom` or similar could be adopted for more complex routing needs).
* Expand and refine mock data structures.
* Build out core functionality within one or two subsections (e.g., Entity Management, Off-Site Monitoring).
