# Beyond Supervision Demo Platform - V0.0

**Version:** 0.0 (Updated Structure)
**Date:** 2025-04-25

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the initial plan and structure for the **Beyond Supervision** Demo Platform. The goal is to create a functional React-based demonstration showcasing modern SupTech (Supervisory Technology) capabilities for financial regulators, drawing inspiration from real-world requirements and advanced concepts like embedded supervision.

## 2. Core Objectives

The platform aims to demonstrate support for the following core supervisory functions:

* Licensing & Registration
* Reporting (Financial, Statistical, Prudential, AML, Ad-hoc)
* Supervision (Macro/Micro, Offsite/Onsite)
* Risk Assessment & Monitoring
* Workflow Management
* Communication & Correspondence
* Dashboards & Analytics
* Audit/Examination Management
* Market Conduct Oversight
* Enforcement Actions

## 3. Technical Stack & Structure

* **Frontend Framework:** React
* **Build Tool / Dev Environment:** Vite (Chosen for fast development server and optimized builds)
* **Layout:** Based on the provided `Layout.js` and `Sidebar.js` components, featuring a fixed left-hand sidebar for navigation (reflecting the new structure) and a main content area.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Planned, based on existing class names and desired look/feel from screenshots). Responsiveness for tablet/laptop sizes is key.
* **State Management:** Likely involves React Context or a dedicated state management library for managing application-wide state and potentially nested navigation state.
* **API Integration:** Plan for numerous API calls. Utilize environment variables (`.env` files supported by Vite) to manage different API endpoints (dev, staging, prod). Consider using an HTTP client library like `axios` for streamlined requests and error handling.

## 4. Key Design Considerations

* **Responsive UI:** Optimized for tablet and laptop displays.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different views/permissions based on user roles.
* **Audit Trail:** Log all significant actions.
* **Localization:** Support for different languages and currencies (placeholders).
* **Secure Communication:** Secure messaging and file exchange.
* **Upload Validation:** Implement validation rules/templates for reporting.
* **Modern UX:** Intuitive navigation (including potential sub-menus), clean layouts, clear workflows.
* **Build Process:** Leverage Vite's optimized build process.
* **High Availability & DR:** Conceptual consideration for resilience.
* **Integration Hooks:** Design with potential integration points.
